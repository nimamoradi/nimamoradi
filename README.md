I am a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science, holding both a Master's and Bachelor's degree in the field. My experience developing and maintaining software applications has allowed me to hone my skills in coding, testing, debugging, and problem-solving. I'm driven by a collaborative spiritâ€”much like the musicians in a dixieland jazz bandâ€”and I bring a meticulous and analytical approach to designing, refining, and delivering reliable, high-performance software solutions.
